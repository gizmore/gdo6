The GDO core is MIT and GDO licensed and shall stay as free as possible at all times.

The GDO folder contains modules, whereas each module 
has to provide it's own, one and only, license.

The GDO Core license does not cover any module.
A few modules are shipped with the core, but they
explicitly state MIT licensed code.

The additional GDO core license (MIT) is attached here.
This MIT license shall be used whenever a gdo6 module uses the MIT license.
