# Install a GDO6 module

This document describes the process of installing a single gdo6 module for a productive environment.

Each gdo6 module is cloned via git into the gdo6/GDO/ folder.

Do not forget a --recursive when you clone a module, as sometimes 3rd party repositories are cloned.

The core module for example needs htmlpurifier.
 

## Clone a module repository

Switch to the module folder and clone the module.

It is important that you clone it as the right module Name.
E.g: gdo6-jquery as JQuery

    cd gdo6/GDO
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/gizmore/gdo6-jquery JQuery

This way it is possible to have different module providers for a module.
A good example is the "Session" module which comes in db and cookie versions.
Another example would be "Captcha" wheras there is currently only one, but re-captcha is planned.
 
    
## Install javascript dependencies

Switch to the gdo root folder and invoke helpers. These install all javascript dependencies in their latest appropiate version.

    cd gdo6
    ./gdo_bower.sh
    ./gdo_yarn.sh
   
   
## Install the module via gdo6 admin panel

Open the gdo6 admin panel and install the module. In recovery cases you can try the install wizard.


## Install the module via command line

    cd gdo6
    php gdoadm.php install <ModuleName>

## Clearing cache via the command line

    php gdoadm.php call Admin ClearCache
    

or if you have gdo6/bin in your PATH environment and gdo6 is installed properly:

    gdo admin.clearcache

    

That's it!
