# What gdo6 does different

Here is a list of things that are different than in some other frameworks.


 - Caches that actually work and are easy to use.
 
 - Almost no dependencies. The core has htmlpurifier and css minify as dependency.
 
 - Single identity cache. One instance per DB row object.
 
 - MTMT architecture instead of MVC. (Model, Type, Method, Template) 
 
 - No composer, but it is planned to support it anytime soon.
 
 - No migration files. They are not required to upgrade your db.
 
 - No template engine. Why learn a template engine syntax when you have PHP?

 - The web and cli installers are written in gdo6.

 - to be continued...
