# Module Ideas or what is left to convert

- AvatarGallery, Usergroups, Guestbook, Shoutbox
- Memcached monitor module
- OpenTimes
- Ordering is tablesort. Sorting is usersort. Know the difference with auto GDT_Sort field and AjaxDnDSorting?
- Kinda ACL for generic ajax data queries? (6.12)
- Make a new Module_Birthday. Move stuff from account there. hook into news for birthday news.
- Make a Module_Session for php default session handling.
# Still todo (issues)

- Make module admin a non dependency. (MethodAdmin)
- No output buffering for ultra responsive pages? => not possible?

- Markup for News,Forum,Links,Downloads is horrible in default design
- Reset ordering by a small button

- Installer: Theme choices are not loading correctly. (module_enabled check?)
- Change cachemiss return type of Memcached to null.
- Change parameter order $code=200, $log=true in GDT_Error and GDT_Success.
- Make multiple forms per page really accurate possible by using $form->name[$field->name] in getVar and templates (done?)
- GDT_Checkbox filter implementation. Also honor undetermined state 2 
- GDT_Date filters

- Modules: 3 iconbuttons: install, configure, adminsection

- Pagemenu shows dot too early?
- Make a static non-db demo site. (does not work yet)

- More tuts

- What is the difference between writable and editable? (writable is still written to db, but cannot be changed from initial â€“ editable accepts user input?)
- Create Javascript minified before performance timing calculations? some sites feel slow but report good timings. i suppose it's Javascript::minify()

- Automatically set a timezone in installer config (UTC), even if none is set in php.ini

- Exceptions should use the same Core/Debug stacktrace as errors.

- Work on SEO. Make sure everything has a title and tags.
