For a complete todo, please grep -R "@TODO" GDO/.

- @TODO: Make Query::order() to use one param "date desc" instead of 2 params "date", false.

- @TODO: Make use of user_type bot. Write a module that identifes bots by their user agent. What else?

- @TODO: Create a method Register::elevateGuest() to turn guests into members. But first think of a concept for that.

- @TODO: Add Ga table GDO_I18n which holds additional translation data editable via website. (see module LanguageEditor)

- @TODO: Add postgres. (thx Nekomander)
