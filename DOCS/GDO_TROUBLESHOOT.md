# GDO6 development troubleshooting

Common pitfalls and possible issues.


## I copied a module as a starting point and it does not show up?

 - Make sure you got the right namespace for your module.


## I only get stacktraces during install.

 - Read them!


## It's all very confusing and not best practice.

 - Do a benchmark!
