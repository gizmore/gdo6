 # GDO6
 
-A modern approach to the 're-inventing the framework wheel' game. I chose PHP because development is quite fast there. Also with type hinting the code completion is almost charmy and it's quite a fast language.
+A modern approach to the 're-inventing the framework wheel' game. I chose PHP because development with it is quite fast. It's also a reasonably performant language, and thanks to type hinting code completion works very well.
 
 
 ## Gizmore Data Objects 6.10

+GDO6 v6.10 is a PHP framework made to easen the development of websites.
+The main audience is creators of highly dynamic webpages such as game sites.
 All code and modules are currently written by myself, ensuring the same code style and "quality".
+That said, everyone is welcome to contribute! You can use pull requests on github or send me a patch file via email if you prefer.
 
-The main difference to other frameworks is the type system; All other frameworks have multiple type systems; one for DB, one for Models and maybe even more.

-In GDO6, the same type system, GDT, applies to all widgets, may it be tables, forms or the DB layer.
-Finally DB datatypes like Geoposition, Email, Password, Decimal, Object, Join, Country, Object, File, Image, Enum, Duration, Serialize, Combobox, Username, DateTime, CreatedBy, AutoInc and many more.

+May it be the Responses, HTML tables, PDF-Documents (PLANNED), Database, Forms, or BinaryWebsocketProtocol(GWS).
 You can also plug a DB gdt in another and re-use it cleverly to reduce allocations.
 
 Validation is an annoying topic in writing applications.
 GDT write their validations once and use them everywhere.
-I cannot remember the last time i had to write validation code.
+I cannot remember the last time I had to write validation code.
 In exchange the GDT System is still a bit tricky to use and program. It's easy to get lost in the code.
 
 The performance is quite okay with responsive timing from around 60ms for complex pages to 30ms for simple pages like a big dynamic sidebar with a contact form.
-On a small vserver there is around a 6MB memory footprint running gdo6 having 108 modules loaded on x86_64 using PHP-7.4.0.
-Numbers could be completely off though, because, hey it's PHP.

 The system is very modular, for example there are currently two message editors available; tinyMCE and CKEditor.
 Of course without such a module you will get a simple textarea.

 ## Why?
 
-I was unhappy with RubyOnRails and recoded my framework from scratch. I took the best ideas from all my experience to create the GDT - GizmoreDataType - System, Which i think is missing on all frameworks i have seen so far.

  - The Web Event System can call hooks in the websocket process.
 
- - No 3rd party template engine: I wrote an own minimal template engine which is just using require. Language specific templates are supported. The GDT_Template can also be used as a normal GDT.

  - Yarn: Some modules come with javascript dependencies. Install all of them easily via ./gdo_yarn.sh
-

  - JS: There is a JS minifier that builds a single .js out of all js assets on the fly. Protect your JS code with that uglyfier via setting an option. (TODO: Protect the source js files)
- 
- - WYSIWYG: GDT_Message allows HTML to be typed by users. HTMLPurifier is used to securely allow that. The module gdo6-tinymce adds a nice editor on top of that. Meanwhile CKEditor is available too, but most people would probably want a Markdown module. It's on todo.

  - Logger: The logger writes logfiles for each user individually.
- 
- - Modular: Plug your site together by cloning modules into the GDO/ folder. Some Modules like Session or Captcha exist in different versions. For example session can be stored serverwide via db or on the clients via AES encryption. The crypto is untested. Multiple Captcha module providers are planned. Want a roboto font or font awesome icons, just clone and install the module and the assets are there in source and build. There are two modules to extend GDT_Message editing; CKEditor and tinyMCE.
- 
- - DBA layer is nicely handwritten in about 2,500 lines of code(LOC). Keep in mind it replaces sophisticated DBA like ActiveRecord or PDO. It works only with MariaDB at the moment, and this is not planned to be changed. The GDO-DBA is doing a nice job in performance and readability. The single-identity, 2-layer-cached engine is quite fun to use and easy to learn. What is missing is stuff like "has_many", "belongs_to", "etc.". The foreign key usage and management is excellent though, combined primary keys and foreign keys are well supported.

  - Want some config in your module? Just return an array of GDT in your GDO_Module::getConfig(). That's it. With one line you get all the validation and editing comfort of any GDT, from which there are over 100 widgets now.

  - Easily create search forms that search the whole db or whole tables for a filter value. Multisorting is supported.
-

  - Can't access the webserver yet? Run any GDO command and manage your installation via CLI. Just "php gdoadm.php install Captcha" and you are ready to go.

  You can also use it as swiss army knife: php gdoadm.php call News Write '{"en" => {"title" => "Trying out gdo6!", "message" => "This news item was created via CLI" }}'

 ## Missing/Questionable features
 
  - The dependency management is not that great yet. There is now at least a mapping from module names to repositories which will be used soon to aid in the installation process.
 
- - The DB-Free, "simple single static sites" use case is not supported yet. Maybe it's easier than i think.

+ - Currently there are only very few Unit Tests. My additional strategy is to issue error mails on any little error, notice or warning. Some Tests are being written and some stuff can be trivially tested. Methods without parameters should throw a 200. Methods should have defined GDT[] gdoParameters() which could even be fuzzed with a couple of lines.
