# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As no-one really uses this, it does not matter much.
There is only one branch, the master one, and all gdo6 installations should be up to date, always.
Roughly you can say a security issue will patch all versions.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| >=6.0.0 | Yes |


## Reporting a Vulnerability

Just write me a mail (gizmore@wechall.net), open an issue, or contact on irc.wechall.net.
A security problem will be fixed asap.
There is no real reward, but helping the gdo6 project is a flag on a hacking challenge on wechall.net :)
